### üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. Validate that DefaultDB is in a running state, if not start it. 
   <br />
2. Download the installation bundle from [Logverz Releases](https://github.com/logleads/LogverzReleases/releases), 
   input parameters description are located at [ParameterReference](https://docs.logverz.io/docs/Getting%20Started/ParameterReference)
   <br />
3. Upload the init-vX.Y.Z.zip bundle to your S3 Logverz-init-XXXX bucket "bin" folder
   <br />
4. Open AWS CloudFormation, search for main Logverz stack, click update, use current template, specify installation bundle path,
   such as bin/init-vX.Y.Z.zip, next, next, acknowledge and submit. This will update application components such as lambda's code 
   webapplication code, build a new container etc.Wait for stack update to finish. 
   <br />
5. üí• Breaking change, specifically for 1.1.X -> 2.0 Logverz upgrade! 
   ![image](../Docs/2.0%20upgrade.png) 
   
   Screenshoot left contains the previous config, the right side contains the new config. Direct upgrade (removing existing config, adding new config )is not possible due to DynamoDB operational limitation: "Cannot perform more than one GSI creation or deletion in a single update".
   <br />
   Open Logverz-Engine.json file, search for "LogverzIdentities" resource. From the AttributeDefinitions property remove text *', { "AttributeName":"USR", "AttributeType":"S"}'*
   Than second step remove the entire USRIndex object.:

         {
					"IndexName" : "USRIndex",
					"KeySchema" : [ { "AttributeName":"USR", "KeyType":"HASH"}, { "AttributeName":"Name", "KeyType":"RANGE"}],
					"Projection" : {
						"ProjectionType" : "ALL"
					}
		}
          
   <br />         
   Upload the modified Logverz-Engine.json to your S3 Logverz-init-XXXX bucket "templates" folder, do not overwrite existing file, name the existing Logverz-Engine.json file as Logverz-Engine.json_original. 
   Open CloudFormation search for main Logverz stack, click update, use Replace existing template,
   for source select Amazon S3 URL, the value will be the url of the Logverz.json file located in S3 Logverz-init-XXXX bucket template folder.
   This will update all infrastructure, such as IAM permissions launch templates etc, and remove the existing IAM property and IAM index as seen on the left of the image.
   <br />
   <br />
6. Open S3 Logverz-init-XXXX bucket "template" folder delete the modified Logverz-Engine.json file rename Logverz-Engine.json_original (same as right side of image) as Logverz-Engine.json.
   Open CloudFormation search for main Logverz stack, click update, use Replace existing template,
   for source select Amazon S3 URL, the value will be the url of the Logverz.json file located in S3 Logverz-init-XXXX bucket template folder.
   This will update all infrastructure, such as IAM permissions launch templates etc.
